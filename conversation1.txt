durant: Hi Josefina
durant: Did you watch the office hours?
→yeah, i did
→but im still lost
durant: Here is the list if you want to revisit them later: https://plus.google.com/events
durant: What have you tried so far?
→ive looked at the code
→i looked at the comments
→i know how to write functions, and how to read them
→im disoriented over how to start
durant: Do you know which file to start with?
durant: Right and player
durant: Did you look at how the game works?
durant: in engine.js
durant: ?
durant: Ok, so you know that main runs update and render over an over again
durant: That's ok!
durant: It will seem hard at first but you can do it!
durant: The idea is that update should change the position of each sprite (image, like for the players, enemies and rocks).
durant: And render will draw the image.
durant: So if you look in engine, you'll see that main just calls update then render
durant: update calls
durant: function update(dt) { updateEntities(dt); // checkCollisions(); }
durant: see: updateEntities
durant: can you look at that now?
durant: in engine.js
→ill look at it
→that updateEntities is meant to update the sprites?
durant: The idea is that update changes the position and render draws it
durant: So for example
durant: suppose I have a bug at position 5,10
durant: and then I update
durant: and now the bug is at 7,10
durant: and I draw
durant: The bug has now "moved" from position 5,10 to 7,10
durant: are you familiar with drawing in the canvas? There is a support course for the canvas : Canvas 2D Edit, the sizzler
durant: I'll get that URL
→ok, thanks. I followed the tutorial.
durant: This is a short course on HTML5 Canvas : https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud292/l-3183538785/m-3239478563
durant: Just 2 lessons
durant: ok, great
→another question:
→what do i need to do to get the image to appear on my html?
→at the beginning..
→cause I wrote a var allEnemies = [];
durant: You can start by trying to draw the background
durant: and then put the player and the enemies on it.
durant: Would you know where to do that?
durant: Can you find the right place?
→not sure...
durant: What does this do: function render on line 106 of engine.js?
durant: When you first try to open the page, you will get errors
durant: the office hours show trying from scratch and then you need to fix those errors
durant: the initial errors are that the player and allEnemies is not defined.
→right
durant: If you fix those errors (by defining something and looking for the errors in the console), then the basic game will start
durant: You will see the background rendered
durant: t
durant: that render function for the background is going to do it for you already
durant: on line 106
durant: And it tells you how to do ctx.drawImage
durant: ctx.drawImage(Resources.get(rowImages[row]), col * 101, row * 83);
durant: which you will need to render your enemies and player.
durant: 

So the basic approach should be:
durant: 
1) Fix the errors you see in the console when you load index.html
durant:
 2) The background should render
durant: 
3) If you implement update and render for your enemies and player, they will reposition (update) and then redraw (render) each time the game loop is called.
durant: How's that for a game plan?
→that sounds good. less daunting.. :)
durant: I know it's hard if you've never seen anything like it before. You sort of have to be an investigator. Starting with the errors in the console.
durant: There are several office hours from the past that also walk you through various parts of the game.
durant: If they don't make sense, you can ask about them on piazza

durant: I'm not sure which cohort you're in, but if you click on the office_hours tag at the top, you should get a filtered list and then look for P3
→on google or on the udacity website?
durant: In piazza
→oh ok
durant: ah,
durant: If you're in the January cohort, you might not have seen them
durant: let me get some for you.

durant: And this office hours starting at 11:45 (I'll paste it, hold on...)

durant: Here's a transcript of the fist one: https://github.com/udacity/FEND_OfficeHourHelp/tree/master/ud015_OOJS
durant: That's more information than you'll need, but you might find it interesting.
