I had quite a bit of a hard time figuring out this game. I didn't know where to start, and I had to talk to instructors about it, and read about 2d collisions.
This article was helpful for instance:

The first step was getting something to appear on the page. For that I had to add the allEnemies array, which was empty and push new enemies into it. 
For check collisions, I had to think it in a way were the two objects were on the same spot + a few pixels cause the objects ocupy more than one pixel. 
Before moving forward with any gems, I decided to added score and lives to html.

To Do: Fix the part where you add score, level and lives. 

Add a gem..make a new function for when you grab a gem that changes color and allow it to disappear so that you can keep playing the game. 
The way you position the gem is by Math.random, but using numbers so that it stays in the pavement, and off the water or the grass.
