I had quite a bit of a hard time figuring out this game. I didn't know where to start, and I had to talk to instructors about it, and read about 2d collisions.
This article was helpful for instance:

The first step was getting something to appear on the page. For that I had to add the allEnemies array, which was empty and push new enemies into it. 
For check collisions, I had to think it in a way were the two objects were on the same spot + a few pixels cause the objects ocupy more than one pixel. 
Before moving forward with any gems, I decided to added score and lives to html.
